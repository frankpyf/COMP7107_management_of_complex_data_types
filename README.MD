## To Build the project
Please ensure CMake is properly installed. Run the setup file in the root directory.  

## To Run the project
Please first create a data directory under the root directory, and put all the data required into that data directory before you run the executables.  
After building, your folder should look like something like this:
```
.
├── build
├── data 
├── src          
├── CMakeLists.txt                  
└── README.md
```

Go to the build directory, find the corresponding assignment folder, and fire it up.
